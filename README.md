Inov project written in java


INOV is a financial services and SaaS Company that offers digitized banking processing software to Banks and Other Financial Institutions.

We build Software for:

- Virtual Credit/Debit card processing
- Domestic & International transactions
- Formal Crypto Banking
- Checking and Savings Account Management

My name is David Okoronkwo. I am a Finance Major and Economics Minor at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut. Over the past year, Three of my friends and I began working on INOV.

INTRO

We have developed a program which we call the DCCS. It is the Digital Credit Code System which we believe will improve the services of the already in place credit/debit card. We use the existing technology of Cryptography which uses generated computer codes for safe encryption of data and other valuable software.

VIRTUAL CREDIT/DEBIT CARD PROCESSING

Virtual Credit/Debit card infrastructure could pose to be the next frontier for Fin-tech and the Whole Finance Sector. The Scale at which it could provide proper financial services across the globe is something I believe should be looked deeply into for R&D and Investment from the Private and Public sector. Through the enablement of high end technology such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and much improved GUI (Graphical User Interfaces) we can properly build Digitized Infrastructures that can be scaled Globally at low cost.

DCCS

The DCCS would allow Financial institutions to more accurately calculate credit score, administer more fair and feasible loans to clients to pay off more serious payments such as mortgages, short and long term loan payments/debts. The DCCS takes away more Administrative/Logistical issues Financial institutions take into account when delivering credit scores to clients such as closure of older accounts and maxing out of cards(for more on this please read the securitization text).

APPLICABLE BUILD

When a Credit/Debit account is made, Each account will produce a generated Cryptography code that will be split into two separate codes and linked to the account of every individual depositor.

The First Code will look like this: b'bpv2KFz3YOfLECe4kUreAVN68zCp3CRdDD4oOgBZJMA='

This code will be hidden from the User and will be stored for Security purposes. The Securitization text goes into full detail on how this will work.

We will then shorten the code to five digits and this will serve as a Virtual Debit card number similar to that of the 16 digit number of a Debit card. This makes it easier for the consumer to memorize the digit number as it is infinitely shorter than the 16 digit codes on Debit cards today.
The Second Code will look like this: b'bpv2K'

This shortened Code would allow us to read in user data much simpler and process financial transactions more efficiently.

SECURITIZATION

If/when an account is breached, the system would pull up the depositor account being breached and proceed to the following steps:

ENTER FIRST CODE

The depositor will be taken to a new page where they would be asked to login by putting in the full original generated Code.

This is the Code that will be required: b'bpv2KFz3YOfLECe4kUreAVN68zCp3CRdDD4oOgBZJMA='

This code has been hidden and is not shown upon the creation of each account. Only the second code is shown because that is the code that facilitates all financial activities through the framework.

This is the second code: b'bpv2K'

GENERATE NEW CODE

With an Inability to access the account due to lack of information, it will be very difficult for any hacker to successfully breach an account. Upon their failure to login, we will email the depositor a temporary pin password in which they can log back into their account and receive a newly generated Code that will be split into the First and Second Code, putting it back into the individual account system. Again for reference,

This is the First Code: b'bpv2KFz3YOfLECe4kUreAVN68zCp3CRdDD4oOgBZJMA='

This is the second code: b'bpv2K'
